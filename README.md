# Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest Questions
1. No, you would not use a unit test to test the "message feature" of a messaging application. It has too many moving parts like the text input and delivering the data to another user.
2. Yes, you should use a unit test to check the max message length feature. It's a small scale feature that's isolated -- changing the other app features wouldn't affect it.
